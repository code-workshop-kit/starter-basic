# Starter basic

Starter setup code-workshop-kit, using a very basic JS app environment, with an index.js entrypoint that contains a default export with a template to be rendered in the participant's capsule/page.

## Installation

```sh
npm i
```

Then

```sh
npm run key && npm run scaffold && npm run start
```
